Those of you who know our work know that a lot of what we've done the last few years is direct service work, with some high level digital security trainings. The last year we are pleased to have been able to support others in learning this work with a number of more advanced trainings around dox defense and other digital security practices relevant for activists in today's movement. After a few proof-of-concept trainings, we are now going to be offering regular webinars on a few of these topics! Initial offerings include:

* Dox defense for activists
* Rapid response dox support
* Vetting new contacts
* Communications best practices for mass mobilizations
* Long-term digital health & wellness for lifelong activists

All webinars will be announced on [our mailing list]({{site.url}}/contact), and you can also [reach out]({{site.url}}/contact) directly to schedule private or in person trainings.

Love and struggle,
ActSecure
