<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
ActSecure is a small collective of technologists working for collective liberation. We believe security work should be intersectional, holistic, and integrated in grassroots movements. We believe community is the best security. While many of our projects do involve securing technological tools against attackers, this is not our primary purpose. The question we are taking on is this: How do we create the security that will allow our communities to move together and rise up?
