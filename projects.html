<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>In addition to trainings, ActSecure will be working on a variety of special projects. Since we're just starting out, here's a short list of some that are in the works</p>

<h3><a href="http://protest.guide">Protest.Guide</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>This will be a single serving website to serve content related to a specific march or protest that's easy to load in situations where cell signal is limited.</li>
</ul>


<h3><a href="http://yourpasswordsarebadandyoushouldfeelbad.info">YourPasswordsAreBadAndYouShouldFeelBad.info</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Currently linking to an xkcd comic, this will be a site dedicated to educated and improving user passwords.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/actsecure">ActSecure Github</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>We have a github page. We're using it to host this site (for now)</li>
</ul>
